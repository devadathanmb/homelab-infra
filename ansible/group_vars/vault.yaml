# Ansible Vault - Shared Credentials (Group-level)
#
# This file contains credentials shared across ALL homelab hosts.
# Host-specific credentials should go in host_vars/<hostname>/vault.yaml
#
# IMPORTANT: Encrypt this file before committing to git!
#
# To encrypt this file:
#   1. First, create a vault password file (if you haven't already):
#      echo 'your-strong-password' > ~/.ansible_vault_pass
#      chmod 600 ~/.ansible_vault_pass
#
#   2. Then encrypt this file:
#      ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/vault.yaml --vault-password-file ~/.ansible_vault_pass
#
# To edit this encrypted file later:
#   ansible-vault edit group_vars/vault.yaml --vault-password-file ~/.ansible_vault_pass
#
# To decrypt (if needed):
#   ansible-vault decrypt group_vars/vault.yaml --vault-password-file ~/.ansible_vault_pass

# Tailscale Auth Key (Reusable across all nodes)
# Generate at: https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys
# Recommendation: Use a reusable auth key with appropriate expiration
# Format: tskey-auth-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
